Our implementation was developed under Julia 0.6.2. The algorithms that have been implemented are listed as below.

## Maximization

- `lazy_greedy`

## Rounding

- `pipage_round`
- `random_round`

## Multilinear Extension

- `get_random_evaluation_of_multilinear_extension`
- `get_random_gradient_of_multilinear_extension`
